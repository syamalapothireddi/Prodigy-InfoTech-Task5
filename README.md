Overview

Welcome to my submission for Task 05 of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy InfoTech.
In this task, I developed a Web Scraping application that extracts product details such as product names, prices, and ratings from an e-commerce website and stores the collected data in a CSV file for easy access and analysis.

Task Description

Task 05: Web Scraping

The objective of this task is to create a program that:

Scrapes product information from an online e-commerce website

Extracts:

Product Name

Price

Rating

Stores the extracted data in a structured CSV format

Allows flexibility in choosing the website to scrape

🌐 Features

Extracts real-time product data

Collects product name, price, and rating

Saves data in CSV format

Handles missing or unavailable values gracefully

Clean and readable output

🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used

Python – Core programming language

BeautifulSoup – HTML parsing

Requests – Fetching web page content

CSV / Pandas – Data storage

Jupyter Notebook / VS Code – Development environment

Programming Concepts Applied

Web scraping fundamentals

HTTP requests

HTML DOM parsing

Data cleaning

File handling

Exception handling

🔍 Program Workflow
1️⃣ Fetch Website Data

Sends an HTTP request to the selected e-commerce website

Retrieves the webpage HTML content

2️⃣ Extract Product Details

Parses HTML using BeautifulSoup

Extracts:

Product name

Product price

Product rating

3️⃣ Clean Data

Removes unnecessary characters

Handles missing values

4️⃣ Save to CSV

Stores extracted data into a CSV file

Organizes data into rows and columns

📁 CSV File Details

The extracted product data is stored in the file:

products.csv

📌 CSV Structure
Column Name	Description
Product Name	Name/title of the product
Price	Product price
Rating	Customer rating
📄 Sample CSV Content
Product Name,Price,Rating
Wireless Mouse,₹599,4.3
Bluetooth Headphones,₹1299,4.5
Smart Watch,₹2499,4.1

💡 Uses of CSV File

Can be opened in Excel / Google Sheets

Used for data analysis and visualization

Helpful for price comparison and insights

⚠️ Note

Web scraping is performed for educational purposes only

Always respect a website’s robots.txt and terms of service

Avoid scraping private or restricted data

Conclusion

This task enhanced my understanding of web scraping, data extraction, and structured data storage.
It demonstrates how Python can automate data collection and prepare datasets for further analysis.
